/**https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview#implement-adapter
 * Implementing your adapter and view holder
 * Once you've determined your layout, you need to implement your Adapter and ViewHolder.
 * These two classes work together to define how your data is displayed.
 * The ViewHolder is a wrapper around a View that contains the layout for an individual item in the list.
 * The Adapter creates ViewHolder objects as needed, and also sets the data for those views.
 * The process of associating views to their data is called binding.
 *
 * When you define your adapter, you need to override three key methods:
 *
 * onCreateViewHolder(): RecyclerView calls this method whenever it needs to create a new ViewHolder.
 * The method creates and initializes the ViewHolder and its associated View, but does not fill in the view's contentsâ€”the ViewHolder has not yet been bound to specific data.
 *
 * onBindViewHolder(): RecyclerView calls this method to associate a ViewHolder with data.
 * The method fetches the appropriate data and uses the data to fill in the view holder's layout.
 * For example, if the RecyclerView displays a list of names, the method might find the appropriate name in the list and fill in the view holder's TextView widget.
 *
 * getItemCount(): RecyclerView calls this method to get the size of the data set.
 * For example, in an address book app, this might be the total number of addresses.
 * RecyclerView uses this to determine when there are no more items that can be displayed.
